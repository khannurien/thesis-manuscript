However, there are several performance-related issues surrounding the state-ofthe-art FaaS platforms that can deter widespread adoption of FaaS, including sizeable overheads, unreliable performance, and new forms of the cost-performance trade-off. In this work we, the SPEC RG Cloud Group, identify six performance-related challenges that arise specifically in this FaaS model, and present our roadmap to tackle these problems in the near future. This paper aims at motivating the community to solve these challenges together.},

	abstract     = {Serverless is a popular choice for cloud service architects because it can provide scalability and load-based billing with minimal developer effort. Functions-as-a-service (FaaS) are originally stateless, but emerging frameworks add stateful abstractions. For instance, the widely used Durable Functions (DF) allow developers to write advanced serverless applications, including reliable workflows and actors, in a programming language of choice. DF implicitly and continuosly persists the state and progress of applications, which greatly simplifies development, but can create an IOps bottleneck.To improve efficiency, we introduce Netherite, a novel architecture for executing serverless workflows on an elastic cluster. Netherite groups the numerous application objects into a smaller number of partitions, and pipelines the state persistence of each partition. This improves latency and throughput, as it enables workflow steps to group commit, even if causally dependent. Moreover, Netherite leverages FASTER's hybrid log approach to support larger-than-memory application state, and to enable efficient partition movement between compute hosts.Our evaluation shows that (a) Netherite achieves lower latency and higher throughput than the original DF engine, by more than an order of magnitude in some cases, and (b) that Netherite has lower latency than some commonly used alternatives, like AWS Step Functions or cloud storage triggers.},

	abstract     = {As the next generation of diverse workloads like autonomous driving and augmented/virtual reality evolves, computation is shifting from cloud-based services to the edge, leading to the emergence of a cloud-edge compute continuum. This continuum promises a wide spectrum of deployment opportunities for workloads that can leverage the strengths of cloud (scalable infrastructure, high reliability) and edge (energy efficient, low latencies). Despite its promises, the continuum has only been studied in silos of various computing models, thus lacking strong endto-end theoretical and engineering foundations for computing and resource management across the continuum. Consequently, developers resort to ad hoc approaches to reason about performance and resource utilization of workloads in the continuum. In this work, we conduct a first-of-its-kind systematic study of various computing models, identify salient properties, and make a case to unify them under a compute continuum reference architecture. This architecture provides an end-to-end analysis framework for developers to reason about resource management, workload distribution, and performance analysis. We demonstrate the utility of the reference architecture by analyzing two popular continuum workloads, deep learning and industrial IoT. We have developed an accompanying deployment and benchmarking framework and first-order analytical model for quantitative reasoning of continuum workloads. The framework is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/atlarge-research/continuum.},

	abstract     = {The energy consumption of under-utilized resources, particularly in a cloud environment, accounts for a substantial amount of the actual energy use. Inherently, a resource allocation strategy that takes into account resource utilization would lead to a better energy efficiency; this, in clouds, extends further with virtualization technologies in that tasks can be easily consolidated. Task consolidation is an effective method to increase resource utilization and in turn reduces energy consumption. Recent studies identified that server energy consumption scales linearly with (processor) resource utilization. This encouraging fact further highlights the significant contribution of task consolidation to the reduction in energy consumption. However, task consolidation can also lead to the freeing up of resources that can sit idling yet still drawing power. There have been some notable efforts to reduce idle power draw, typically by putting computer resources into some form of sleep/power-saving mode. In this paper, we present two energy-conscious task consolidation heuristics, which aim to maximize resource utilization and explicitly take into account both active and idle energy consumption. Our heuristics assign each task to the resource on which the energy consumption for executing the task is explicitly or implicitly minimized without the performance degradation of that task. Based on our experimental results, our heuristics demonstrate their promising energy-saving capability.},

This needs a systematic evaluation of the as-is scenario to identify potential areas for improvement and quantify the impact of any strategy. We present a measurement study of a production datacenter from a joint perspective of power and performance at the individual server level. Our observations help correlate power consumption of production servers with their activity, and identify easily implementable improvements. We find that production servers are underutilized from an activity perspective; are overrated from a power perspective; execute temporally similar workloads over a granularity of weeks; do not idle efficiently; and have power consumptions that are well tracked by their CPU utilizations. Our measurements suggest the following steps for improvement: staggering periodic activities on servers; enabling deeper sleep states; and provisioning based on measurement.},

  abstract = {In order to conserve energy, battery powered embedded systems are typically designed with very low-power modules that offer limited computational power and communication bandwidth and therefore, are generally applicable to low-sample-rate intermittent applications. On the other hand, enabling an embedded system with a high-throughput processing resource such as an FPGA, high-throughput processing performance that is typically required in high-sample rate monitoring applications can be achieved. However, the high power consumption associated with an FPGA poses a major challenge in attaining significant lifetime for a battery-powered embedded system. In this paper, we investigate energy consumption of an SRAM-based FPGA in relation to dutycycle applications. In order to achieve long operational lifetime in an FPGA-based embedded system, the possible options to dynamically manage the power consumption are studied and discussed. The experimental results suggest that the SRAM-based FPGA, XC6SLX16 that provides ample logic resources in relation to typical high-sample rate monitoring applications, can be used in a battery operated embedded systems while minimizing the energy consumption to 2.56 mJ for inactive duration of 235 ms or above.},

	abstract     = {Cloud-based hosting promises cost advantages over conventional in-house (on-premise) application deployment. One important question when considering a move to the cloud is whether it makes sense for `my' application to migrate to the cloud. This question is challenging to answer due to following reasons. Although many potential benefits of migrating to the cloud can be enumerated, some benefits may not apply to `my' application. Also, there can be multiple ways in which an application might make use of the facilities offered by cloud providers. Answering these questions requires an in-depth understanding of the cost implications of all the possible choices specific to `my' circumstances. In this study We identify an initial set of key factors affecting the costs of a deployement choice. Using benchmarks representing two different applications (TPC-W and TPC-E) we investigate the evolution of costs for different deployment choices. We show that application characteristics such as workload intensity, growth rate, storage capacity and software licensing costs produce complex combined effect on overall costs. We also discuss issues regarding workload variance and horizontal partitioning.},

Employees, however, have been exposed to different security risks because of working from home. Moreover, the rapid global spread of COVID-19 has increased the volume of data generated from various sources. Working from home depends mainly on cloud computing (CC) applications that help employees to efficiently accomplish their tasks. The cloud computing environment (CCE) is an unsung hero in the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. It consists of the fast-paced practices for services that reflect the trend of rapidly deployable applications for maintaining data. Despite the increase in the use of CC applications, there is an ongoing research challenge in the domains of CCE concerning data, guaranteeing security, and the availability of CC applications. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first paper that thoroughly explains the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on CCE. Additionally, this paper also highlights the security risks of working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Many types of resource contention occur, with important impact on the performance and sometimes even the reliability of applications running in cloud datacenters. Cloud applications run together on the same physical machines with different workloads resulting in non-synchronized accesses to the shared resources. This leads to cases where co-hosted applications are contending for the common resources and not receiving the demanded resource amounts. In this work, we investigate the contention in CPU resources, as CPU is allowed to be over-committed by typical SLAs. We propose a CPU-contention predictor for the demanding business-critical workloads, which require low resource contention to deliver the required performance to customers. Our predictor is based on a set of regression models and metrics which we evaluate extensively. We tune the predictor with data collected from a real-world cloud operation spanning multiple datacenters and servicing businesscritical workloads.},

Such congestion is often caused when parallel processes within an application that execute similar operations share the same resources. Previous research suggests using fewer cores with better process-to-core mapping can improve applications' performance but leaves many cores unused. To utilize these cores, we colocate additional applications and map them using a topology-aware process-tocore, application-agnostic mapping algorithm. We show that these mappings significantly impact memory bandwidth and communication latency. We evaluate our approach using eight parallel applications on an HPC system with 128-core nodes, demonstrating the performance effects of mappings combined with colocation. Our goal is to determine whether colocation with topology-aware mapping is a viable alternative to typical exclusive node allocation. Our results show makespan improvements of 2.4x over exclusive allocation in an HPC system, demonstrating the potential benefits of colocation with optimized mappings.},

	abstract     = {Distributed systems such as grids, peer-to-peer systems, and even Internet DNS servers have grown significantly in size and complexity in the last decade. This rapid growth has allowed distributed systems to serve a large and increasing number of users, but has also made resource and system failures inevitable. Moreover, perhaps as a result of system complexity, in distributed systems a single failure can trigger within a short time span several more failures, forming a group of time-correlated failures. To eliminate or alleviate the significant effects of failures on performance and functionality, the techniques for dealing with failures require good failure models. However, not many such models are available, and the available models are valid for few or even a single distributed system. In contrast, in this work we propose a model that considers groups of time-correlated failures and is valid for many types of distributed systems. Our model includes three components, the group size, the group inter-arrival time, and the resource downtime caused by the group. To validate this model, we use failure traces corresponding to fifteen distributed systems. We find that space-correlated failures are dominant in terms of resource downtime in seven of the fifteen studied systems. For each of these seven systems, we provide a set of model parameters that can be used in research studies or for tuning distributed systems. Last, as a result of our work six of the studied traces have been made available through the Failure Trace Archive (http://fta.inria.fr).},

While numerous failure models and failure-aware algorithms exist, their comparison has been hampered by the lack of public failure data sets and data processing tools. To facilitate the design, validation, and comparison of fault-tolerant models and algorithms, we have created the Failure Trace Archive (FTA)---an online, public repository of failure traces collected from diverse parallel and distributed systems. In this work, we first describe the design of the archive, in particular of the standard FTA data format, and the design of a toolbox that facilitates automated analysis of trace data sets. We also discuss the use of the FTA for various current and future purposes. Second, after applying the toolbox to nine failure traces collected from distributed systems used in various application domains (e.g., HPC, Internet operation, and various online applications), we present a comparative analysis of failures in various distributed systems. Our analysis presents various statistical insights and typical statistical modeling results for the availability of individual resources in various distributed systems. The analysis results underline the need for public availability of trace data from different distributed systems. Last, we show how different interpretations of the meaning of failure data can result in different conclusions for failure modeling and job scheduling in distributed systems. Our results for different interpretations show evidence that there may be a need for further revisiting existing failure-aware algorithms, when applied for general rather than for domain-specific distributed systems. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Data centers are more and more relying on hybrid storage systems consisting of flash memory based storage devices and traditional hard disk drives. Optimal data placement in such hybrid storage systems is a very important issue in the domain of cloud computing and virtualization. This is specially the case when users need that storage systems enforce Quality of Service requirements on I/Os performed, for example for multimedia applications. To characterize Virtual Machine (VM) I/O workload properties such as timing predictability or throughput, monitoring services are necessary on such new architectures. This article presents a multilevel I/O tracer for virtual machines that relies on and complement different state-of-the-art tools. It produces I/O traces at different levels of the Linux I/O software stack. The I/O tracer gives an exhaustive information that allows administrators to precisely characterize virtual machine I/O behavior in terms of percentage of read/write I/Os, percentage of random/sequential, I/O request inter-arrival time, etc. This tool is the first piece towards a middleware whose purpose is to meet user QoS requirements thanks to optimal data placement and migration policies in a hybrid storage system in the context of an IaaS Cloud.},

Setting the right level of overcommitment is a challenging problem: low overcommitment leads to wasted resources, while high overcommitment leads to task performance degradation. In this paper, we take a first principles approach to designing and evaluating overcommit policies by asking a basic question: assuming complete knowledge of each task's future resource usage, what is the safest overcommit policy that yields the highest utilization? We call this policy the peak oracle. We then devise practical overcommit policies that mimic this peak oracle by predicting future machine resource usage. We simulate our overcommit policies using the recentlyreleased Google cluster trace, and show that they result in higher utilization and less overcommit errors than policies based on per-task allocations. We also deploy these policies to machines inside Google's datacenters serving its internal production workload. We show that our overcommit policies increase these machines' usable CPU capacity by 10-16\% compared to no overcommitment.},

A thorough understanding of these characteristics can inform the providers' resource management systems, e.g. VM scheduler, power manager, server health manager. In this paper, we first introduce an extensive characterization of Microsoft Azure's VM workload, including distributions of the VMs' lifetime, deployment size, and resource consumption. We then show that certain VM behaviors are fairly consistent over multiple lifetimes, i.e. history is an accurate predictor of future behavior. Based on this observation, we next introduce Resource Central (RC), a system that collects VM telemetry, learns these behaviors offline, and provides predictions online to various resource managers via a general client-side library. As an example of RC's online use, we modify Azure's VM scheduler to leverage predictions in oversubscribing servers (with oversubscribable VM types), while retaining high VM performance. Using real VM traces, we then show that the prediction-informed schedules increase utilization and prevent physical resource exhaustion. We conclude that providers can exploit their workloads' characteristics and machine learning to improve resource management substantially.},

On the other hand, power models and vendor-specific internal interfaces are already available or can be implemented on existing systems. Plenty of tools, called software-based power meters, have been developed around the concepts of power models and internal interfaces, in order to report the power consumption at levels ranging from the whole computing node to applications and services. However, we have found that it can be difficult to choose the right tool for a specific need. In this work, we qualitatively and experimentally compare several software-based power meters able to deal with CPU or GPU-based infrastructures.

Our research first compares experimentally the accuracy of the existing integrated frameworks.

However, elasticity still lacks a precise definition as well as representative metrics coupled with a benchmarking methodology to enable comparability of systems. Existing definitions of elasticity are largely inconsistent and unspecific, which leads to confusion in the use of the term and its differentiation from related terms such as scalability and efficiency; the proposed measurement methodologies do not provide means to quantify elasticity without mixing it with efficiency or scalability aspects. In this short paper, we propose a precise definition of elasticity and analyze its core properties and requirements explicitly distinguishing from related terms such as scalability and efficiency.

Hence, many research autoscalers do not find their way into production deployments. This paper describes six core challenges that arise in production systems that are still not solved by most research autoscalers. We illustrate these problems through experiments in a realistic cloud environment with a real-world multi-service business application and show that commonly used autoscalers have various shortcomings. In addition, we analyze the behavior of overloaded services and show that these can be problematic for existing autoscalers. Generally, we analyze that these challenges are only insufficiently addressed in the literature and conclude that future scaling approaches should focus on the needs of production systems.},

Thus, in this paper, we investigate the fundamental significance of the weights in terms of preferences, the Pareto optimal set, and objective-function values.

With cloud data centers' carbon footprint rising sharply, understanding and minimizing the carbon impact of serverless functions becomes crucial. The unique characteristics of serverless functions, such as event-driven invocation, pay-as-you-go billing model, short execution duration, ephemeral runtime, and opaque underlying infrastructure, pose challenges in effective carbon metering. In this paper, we argue that the current carbon estimation methodologies should be expanded for more accurate carbon accounting in serverless settings, and propose a usage and allocation-based carbon model that aligns with the context of serverless computing. We also articulate how current serverless systems and billing models do not make it financially attractive to prioritize sustainability for a broad class of users and developers. To solve this, we propose a new carbon-aware pricing model and evaluate its ability to incentivize sustainable practices for developers through better alignment of billing and carbon efficiency.},

Moreover, they have to struggle with huge amounts of data that they create or have to process. To improve the self-awareness of such systems and enable proactive and autonomous decisions, reliable time series forecasting methods are required. However, selecting a suitable forecasting method for a given scenario is a challenging task. According to the ``No-Free-Lunch Theorem,'' there is no general forecasting method that always performs best. Thus, manual feature engineering remains to be a mandatory expert task to avoid trial and error. Furthermore, determining the expected time-to-result of existing forecasting methods is a challenge. In this article, we extensively assess the state-of-the-art in time series forecasting. We compare existing methods and discuss the issues that have to be addressed to enable their use in a self-aware computing context. To address these issues, we present a step-by-step approach to fully automate the feature engineering and forecasting process. Then, following the principles from benchmarking, we establish a level-playing field for evaluating the accuracy and time-to-result of automated forecasting methods for a broad set of application scenarios. We provide results of a benchmarking competition to guide in selecting and appropriately using existing forecasting methods for a given self-aware computing context. Finally, we present a case study in the area of self-aware data-center resource management to exemplify the benefits of fully automated learning and reasoning processes on time series data.},

	abstract     = {Serverless functions are an emerging cloud computing paradigm that is being rapidly adopted by both industry and academia. In this cloud computing model, the provider opaquely handles resource management tasks such as resource provisioning, deployment, and auto-scaling. The only resource management task that developers are still in charge of is selecting how much resources are allocated to each worker instance. However, selecting the optimal size of serverless functions is quite challenging, so developers often neglect it despite its significant cost and performance benefits. Existing approaches aiming to automate serverless functions resource sizing require dedicated performance tests, which are time-consuming to implement and maintain.In this paper, we introduce an approach to predict the optimal resource size of a serverless function using monitoring data from a single resource size. As our approach does not require dedicated performance tests, it enables cloud providers to implement resource sizing on a platform level and automate the last resource management task associated with serverless functions. We evaluate our approach on four different serverless applications on AWS, where it predicts the execution time of the other memory sizes based on monitoring data for a single memory size with an average prediction error of 15.3\%. Based on these predictions, it selects the optimal memory size for 79.0\% of the serverless functions and the second-best memory size for 12.3\% of the serverless functions, which results in an average speedup of 39.7\% while also decreasing average costs by 2.6\%.},

However, a significant hurdle remains in the form of the cold start problem, causing latency when launching new function instances from scratch. Existing solutions tend to use oversimplistic strategies for function pre-loading/unloading without full invocation pattern exploitation, rendering unsatisfactory optimization of the trade-off between cold start latency and resource waste. To bridge this gap, we propose SPES, the first differentiated scheduler for runtime cold start mitigation by optimizing serverless function provision. Our insight is that the common architecture of serverless systems prompts the concentration of certain invocation patterns, leading to predictable invocation behaviors. This allows us to categorize functions and pre-load/unload proper function instances with finer-grained strategies based on accurate invocation prediction. Experiments demonstrate the success of SPES in optimizing serverless function provision on both sides: reducing the 75th-percentile cold start rates by 49.77\% and the wasted memory time by 56.43\%, compared to the state-of-the-art. By mitigating the cold start issue, SPES is a promising advancement in facilitating cloud services deployed on serverless architectures.},

Similar to the monolith, autoscaling has attracted the attention of operators for managing the resource utilization of microservices. However, it is still challenging to optimize resources in terms of latency service-level-objective (SLO) without human intervention. In this paper, we present GRAF, a graph neural networkbased SLO-aware proactive resource autoscaling framework for minimizing total CPU resources while satisfying latency SLO. GRAF leverages front-end workload, distributed tracing data, and machine learning approaches to (a) observe/estimate the impact of traffic change (b) find optimal resource combinations (c) make proactive resource allocation. Experiments using various open-source benchmarks demonstrate that GRAF successfully targets latency SLO while saving up to 19\% of total CPU resources compared to the fine-tuned autoscaler. GRAF also handles a traffic surge with 36\% fewer resources while achieving up to 2.6x faster tail latency convergence compared to the Kubernetes autoscaler. Moreover, we verify the scalability of GRAF on large-scale deployments, where GRAF saves 21.6\% and 25.4\% for CPU resources and memory resources, respectively.},

  abstract = {Cloud data center capacities are over-provisioned to handle demand peaks and hardware failures which leads to low resources' utilization. One way to improve resource utilization and thus reduce the total cost of ownership is to offer unused resources (referred to as ephemeral resources) at a lower price. However, reselling resources needs to meet the expectations of its customers in terms of Quality of Service. The goal is so to maximize the amount of reclaimed resources while avoiding SLA penalties. To achieve that, cloud providers have to estimate their future utilization to provide availability guarantees. The prediction should consider a safety margin for resources to react to unpredictable workloads. The challenge is to find the safety margin that provides the best trade-off between the amount of resources to reclaim and the risk of SLA violations. Most state-of-the-art solutions consider a fixed safety margin for all types of metrics (e.g., CPU, RAM). However, a unique fixed margin does not consider various workloads variations over time which may lead to SLA violations or/and poor utilization. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose ReLeaSER, a Reinforcement Learning strategy for optimizing the ephemeral resources' utilization in the cloud. ReLeaSER dynamically tunes the safety margin at the host-level for each resource metric. The strategy learns from past prediction errors (that caused SLA violations). Our solution reduces significantly the SLA violation penalties on average by 2.7{\texttimes} and up to 3.4{\texttimes}. It also improves considerably the CPs' potential savings by 27.6\% on average and up to 43.6\%.},

Cassandra aims to run on top of an infrastructure of hundreds of nodes (possibly spread across different data centers). At this scale, small and large components fail continuously. The way Cassandra manages the persistent state in the face of these failures drives the reliability and scalability of the software systems relying on this service. While in many ways Cassandra resembles a database and shares many design and implementation strategies therewith, Cassandra does not support a full relational data model; instead, it provides clients with a simple data model that supports dynamic control over data layout and format. Cassandra system was designed to run on cheap commodity hardware and handle high write throughput while not sacrificing read efficiency.},

We leverage device intelligence by distributing data replication, failure detection and recovery to semi-autonomous OSDs running a specialized local object file system. A dynamic distributed metadata cluster provides extremely efficient metadata management and seamlessly adapts to a wide range of general purpose and scientific computing file system workloads. Performance measurements under a variety of workloads show that Ceph has excellent I/O performance and scalable metadata management, supporting more than 250,000 metadata operations per second.},

This exponential increase in the demand for storage and access to data is the result of fundamental changes in the economics of underlying technologies. The speed and accuracy of data collection has more than doubled. The speed of data transmission has risen an order of magnitude while price has halved. The cost per megabyte of permanent storage has dropped by an order of magnitude. Client desktop computers have gone from .5 MIPS to 100 MIPS. These underlying factors have created user demands for data servers of unprecedented proportions. Oracle relational database technology implemented on Massively Parallel hardware architectures allows both OLTP and Decsision support on the same database image. Both queries and transaction processing power scale linearly on MPP platforms. This technology delivers scalable RDBMS super-servers.},

The word scalable, or scalability, has been widely and often used in the parallel processingcommunity. However, there is no adequate, commonly accepted definition of scalability available. Scalabilities of computer systems and programs are difficult to quantify, evaluate, and compare. In this paper, scalability is formally defined for algorithm-machine combinations.A practical method is proposed to provide a quantitative measurement of the scalability. The relationbetween the newly proposed scalability and other existing parallel performance metrics is studied. A harmony between speedup and scalability has been observed. Theoretical results show that a large class of algorithm-machine combinations is scalable and the scalability can be predictedthrough premeasured machine parameters. Two algorithms have been studied on an ,)CUBE 2 mullicomputer and on a MasPar MP-1 computer. These case studies have shown how scalabilitiescan be measured, computed,and predicted.Performanceinstrumentationand visualization tools also have been used and developed to understand the scalability related behavior.},

	abstract     = {Autoscaling has been one of the most active research areas since the beginning of the cloud computing era. Nearly all previously proposed approaches focus on decision-making based on averaged monitoring values of many service instances at fixed points in time. This limits responsiveness and can lead to service level objective (SLO) violations when the load suddenly increases. Our vision of continuous decentralized autoscaling avoids these issues by giving individual service instances the power to make scaling decisions in a distributed fashion. Each instance performs self-monitoring and evaluates its state. The service instance initiates upscaling if it detects an overload or downscaling if its load is below a specified threshold. By randomly determining scaling timing, we achieve quasi-continuous scaling behavior when multiple service instances are deployed. We discuss challenges regarding analytical modeling, simulation, and real-world evaluation of this approach.},
