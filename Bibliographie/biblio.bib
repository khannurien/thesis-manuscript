This needs a systematic evaluation of the as-is scenario to identify potential areas for improvement and quantify the impact of any strategy. We present a measurement study of a production datacenter from a joint perspective of power and performance at the individual server level. Our observations help correlate power consumption of production servers with their activity, and identify easily implementable improvements. We find that production servers are underutilized from an activity perspective; are overrated from a power perspective; execute temporally similar workloads over a granularity of weeks; do not idle efficiently; and have power consumptions that are well tracked by their CPU utilizations. Our measurements suggest the following steps for improvement: staggering periodic activities on servers; enabling deeper sleep states; and provisioning based on measurement.},

Many types of resource contention occur, with important impact on the performance and sometimes even the reliability of applications running in cloud datacenters. Cloud applications run together on the same physical machines with different workloads resulting in non-synchronized accesses to the shared resources. This leads to cases where co-hosted applications are contending for the common resources and not receiving the demanded resource amounts. In this work, we investigate the contention in CPU resources, as CPU is allowed to be over-committed by typical SLAs. We propose a CPU-contention predictor for the demanding business-critical workloads, which require low resource contention to deliver the required performance to customers. Our predictor is based on a set of regression models and metrics which we evaluate extensively. We tune the predictor with data collected from a real-world cloud operation spanning multiple datacenters and servicing businesscritical workloads.},

Such congestion is often caused when parallel processes within an application that execute similar operations share the same resources. Previous research suggests using fewer cores with better process-to-core mapping can improve applications' performance but leaves many cores unused. To utilize these cores, we colocate additional applications and map them using a topology-aware process-tocore, application-agnostic mapping algorithm. We show that these mappings significantly impact memory bandwidth and communication latency. We evaluate our approach using eight parallel applications on an HPC system with 128-core nodes, demonstrating the performance effects of mappings combined with colocation. Our goal is to determine whether colocation with topology-aware mapping is a viable alternative to typical exclusive node allocation. Our results show makespan improvements of 2.4x over exclusive allocation in an HPC system, demonstrating the potential benefits of colocation with optimized mappings.},

  abstract = {Distributed systems such as grids, peer-to-peer systems, and even Internet DNS servers have grown significantly in size and complexity in the last decade. This rapid growth has allowed distributed systems to serve a large and increasing number of users, but has also made resource and system failures inevitable. Moreover, perhaps as a result of system complexity, in distributed systems a single failure can trigger within a short time span several more failures, forming a group of time-correlated failures. To eliminate or alleviate the significant effects of failures on performance and functionality, the techniques for dealing with failures require good failure models. However, not many such models are available, and the available models are valid for few or even a single distributed system. In contrast, in this work we propose a model that considers groups of time-correlated failures and is valid for many types of distributed systems. Our model includes three components, the group size, the group inter-arrival time, and the resource downtime caused by the group. To validate this model, we use failure traces corresponding to fifteen distributed systems. We find that space-correlated failures are dominant in terms of resource downtime in seven of the fifteen studied systems. For each of these seven systems, we provide a set of model parameters that can be used in research studies or for tuning distributed systems. Last, as a result of our work six of the studied traces have been made available through the Failure Trace Archive (http://fta.inria.fr).},

While numerous failure models and failure-aware algorithms exist, their comparison has been hampered by the lack of public failure data sets and data processing tools. To facilitate the design, validation, and comparison of fault-tolerant models and algorithms, we have created the Failure Trace Archive (FTA)---an online, public repository of failure traces collected from diverse parallel and distributed systems. In this work, we first describe the design of the archive, in particular of the standard FTA data format, and the design of a toolbox that facilitates automated analysis of trace data sets. We also discuss the use of the FTA for various current and future purposes. Second, after applying the toolbox to nine failure traces collected from distributed systems used in various application domains (e.g., HPC, Internet operation, and various online applications), we present a comparative analysis of failures in various distributed systems. Our analysis presents various statistical insights and typical statistical modeling results for the availability of individual resources in various distributed systems. The analysis results underline the need for public availability of trace data from different distributed systems. Last, we show how different interpretations of the meaning of failure data can result in different conclusions for failure modeling and job scheduling in distributed systems. Our results for different interpretations show evidence that there may be a need for further revisiting existing failure-aware algorithms, when applied for general rather than for domain-specific distributed systems. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In this context, elasticity is commonly understood as the ability of a system to automatically provision and deprovision computing resources on demand as workloads change. However, elasticity still lacks a precise definition as well as representative metrics coupled with a benchmarking methodology to enable comparability of systems. Existing definitions of elasticity are largely inconsistent and unspecific, which leads to confusion in the use of the term and its differentiation from related terms such as scalability and efficiency; the proposed measurement methodologies do not provide means to quantify elasticity without mixing it with efficiency or scalability aspects. In this short paper, we propose a precise definition of elasticity and analyze its core properties and requirements explicitly distinguishing from related terms such as scalability and efficiency. Furthermore, we present a set of appropriate elasticity metrics and sketch a new elasticity tailored benchmarking methodology addressing the special requirements on workload design and calibration.},

Although there has been active research in this area for over ten years now, there is still a significant gap between the proposed methods in the literature and the deployed autoscalers in practice. Hence, many research autoscalers do not find their way into production deployments. This paper describes six core challenges that arise in production systems that are still not solved by most research autoscalers. We illustrate these problems through experiments in a realistic cloud environment with a real-world multi-service business application and show that commonly used autoscalers have various shortcomings. In addition, we analyze the behavior of overloaded services and show that these can be problematic for existing autoscalers. Generally, we analyze that these challenges are only insufficiently addressed in the literature and conclude that future scaling approaches should focus on the needs of production systems.},

Moreover, they have to struggle with huge amounts of data that they create or have to process. To improve the self-awareness of such systems and enable proactive and autonomous decisions, reliable time series forecasting methods are required. However, selecting a suitable forecasting method for a given scenario is a challenging task. According to the ``No-Free-Lunch Theorem,'' there is no general forecasting method that always performs best. Thus, manual feature engineering remains to be a mandatory expert task to avoid trial and error. Furthermore, determining the expected time-to-result of existing forecasting methods is a challenge. In this article, we extensively assess the state-of-the-art in time series forecasting. We compare existing methods and discuss the issues that have to be addressed to enable their use in a self-aware computing context. To address these issues, we present a step-by-step approach to fully automate the feature engineering and forecasting process. Then, following the principles from benchmarking, we establish a level-playing field for evaluating the accuracy and time-to-result of automated forecasting methods for a broad set of application scenarios. We provide results of a benchmarking competition to guide in selecting and appropriately using existing forecasting methods for a given self-aware computing context. Finally, we present a case study in the area of self-aware data-center resource management to exemplify the benefits of fully automated learning and reasoning processes on time series data.},

  abstract = {Serverless functions are a cloud computing paradigm where the provider takes care of resource management tasks such as resource provisioning, deployment, and auto-scaling. The only resource management task that developers are still in charge of is selecting how much resources are allocated to each worker instance. However, selecting the optimal size of serverless functions is quite challenging, so developers often neglect it despite its significant cost and performance benefits. Existing approaches aiming to automate serverless functions resource sizing require dedicated performance tests, which are time-consuming to implement and maintain. In this paper, we introduce an approach to predict the optimal resource size of a serverless function using monitoring data from a single resource size. As our approach does not require dedicated performance tests, it enables cloud providers to implement resource sizing on a platform level and automate the last resource management task associated with serverless functions. We evaluate our approach on four different serverless applications on AWS, where it predicts the execution time of the other memory sizes based on monitoring data for a single memory size with an average prediction error of 15.3\%. Based on these predictions, it selects the optimal memory size for 79.0\% of the serverless functions and the second-best memory size for 12.3\% of the serverless functions, which results in an average speedup of 39.7\% while also decreasing average costs by 2.6\%.},

  abstract = {As an emerging cloud computing deployment paradigm, serverless computing is gaining traction due to its efficiency and ability to harness on-demand cloud resources. However, a significant hurdle remains in the form of the cold start problem, causing latency when launching new function instances from scratch. Existing solutions tend to use oversimplistic strategies for function pre-loading/unloading without full invocation pattern exploitation, rendering unsatisfactory optimization of the trade-off between cold start latency and resource waste. To bridge this gap, we propose SPES, the first differentiated scheduler for runtime cold start mitigation by optimizing serverless function provision. Our insight is that the common architecture of serverless systems prompts the concentration of certain invocation patterns, leading to predictable invocation behaviors. This allows us to categorize functions and pre-load/unload proper function instances with finer-grained strategies based on accurate invocation prediction. Experiments demonstrate the success of SPES in optimizing serverless function provision on both sides: reducing the 75th-percentile cold start rates by 49.77\% and the wasted memory time by 56.43\%, compared to the state-of-the-art. By mitigating the cold start issue, SPES is a promising advancement in facilitating cloud services deployed on serverless architectures.},

Similar to the monolith, autoscaling has attracted the attention of operators for managing the resource utilization of microservices. However, it is still challenging to optimize resources in terms of latency service-level-objective (SLO) without human intervention. In this paper, we present GRAF, a graph neural networkbased SLO-aware proactive resource autoscaling framework for minimizing total CPU resources while satisfying latency SLO. GRAF leverages front-end workload, distributed tracing data, and machine learning approaches to (a) observe/estimate the impact of traffic change (b) find optimal resource combinations (c) make proactive resource allocation. Experiments using various open-source benchmarks demonstrate that GRAF successfully targets latency SLO while saving up to 19\% of total CPU resources compared to the fine-tuned autoscaler. GRAF also handles a traffic surge with 36\% fewer resources while achieving up to 2.6x faster tail latency convergence compared to the Kubernetes autoscaler. Moreover, we verify the scalability of GRAF on large-scale deployments, where GRAF saves 21.6\% and 25.4\% for CPU resources and memory resources, respectively.},

  abstract = {Autoscaling has been one of the most active research areas since the beginning of the cloud computing era. Nearly all previously proposed approaches focus on decision-making based on averaged monitoring values of many service instances at fixed points in time. This limits responsiveness and can lead to service level objective (SLO) violations when the load suddenly increases. Our vision of continuous decentralized autoscaling avoids these issues by giving individual service instances the power to make scaling decisions in a distributed fashion. Each instance performs self-monitoring and evaluates its state. The service instance initiates upscaling if it detects an overload or downscaling if its load is below a specified threshold. By randomly determining scaling timing, we achieve quasi-continuous scaling behavior when multiple service instances are deployed. We discuss challenges regarding analytical modeling, simulation, and real-world evaluation of this approach.},
