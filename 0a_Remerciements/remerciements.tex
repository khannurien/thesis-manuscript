    \footnotesize \textit{Third thing about computers, they're really dumb. They're exceptionally simple, but they're really fast. The raw instructions that we have to feed these little microprocessors, even the raw instructions that we have to feed these giant Cray-1 supercomputers, are the most trivial of instructions. They're: Get some data from here, get a number from here, fetch a number, add two numbers together, test to see if it's bigger than zero. Go put it over there. It's the most mundane thing you could ever imagine.

    But a key thing about it is that, let's say I could move 100 times faster than anyone in here. In the blink of your eye, I could run out there and I could grab a bouquet of fresh spring flowers or something. And I could run back in here and I could snap my fingers, and you would all think I was a magician or something. And yet I was basically doing a series of really simple instructions: moving, running out there, grabbing some flowers, running back, snapping my fingers. But I could just do them so fast that you would think that there was something magical going on.}
